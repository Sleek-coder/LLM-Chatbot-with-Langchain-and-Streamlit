# Chatbot-with-Langchain-and-Streamlit
LLM Chatbot with LangChain and Streamlit

Overview

This project is a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot built using LangChain for orchestration and Streamlit for the user interface. The chatbot allows users to interact with an AI-powered conversational agent that leverages a powerful language model to generate meaningful and context-aware responses.

Features

LLM Integration: Uses a pre-trained language model (OpenAI GPT, Llama, or other LLMs) for natural language understanding and response generation.

LangChain Pipeline: Utilizes LangChain for enhanced prompt engineering, memory management, and LLM orchestration.

Streamlit UI: Provides a simple, interactive web-based chat interface.

Memory Management: Maintains conversational context for more engaging discussions.

API Support: Can integrate with external APIs for additional functionalities like database queries and real-time information retrieval.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Pip package manager

OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI models)

Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/llm-chatbot.git](https://github.com/Sleek-coder/LLM-Chatbot-with-Langchain-and-Streamlit)

cd llm-chatbot

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
Finetune your opensource model or access model using Ollama 
Create a .env file in the project root directory and add the necessary API keys:
