# Chatbot-with-Langchain-and-Streamlit
LLM Chatbot with LangChain and Streamlit

Overview

This project is a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot built using LangChain for orchestration and Streamlit for the user interface. The chatbot allows users to interact with an AI-powered conversational agent that leverages a powerful language model to generate meaningful and context-aware responses.

Features

LLM Integration: Uses a pre-trained language model (OpenAI GPT, Llama, or other LLMs) for natural language understanding and response generation.

LangChain Pipeline: Utilizes LangChain for enhanced prompt engineering, memory management, and LLM orchestration.

Streamlit UI: Provides a simple, interactive web-based chat interface.

Memory Management: Maintains conversational context for more engaging discussions.
